### Hi, I'm Richard
***
I'm studying Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo and I'm an aspiring software engineer. My interest is in backend systems, 

- Prev: Fullstack @ Jitto working on AWS cloud things(Cloudformation, RDS, Lambdas), some scripts leveraging parallel processing, also API optimizations + data pipelines

- Outside of work, I enjoy improving my coding skills by spending extended periods of time working on projects. I also enjoy Muay Thai. 

***
What I'm currently Learning:

- Backend with Rust, sometimes Go, exploring gRPC and pub/sub messaging systems
- Leetcode grind (backtracking, dp, graphs, etc)
- Converting all of Wikipedia into a binary formatted graph for efficient traversal
