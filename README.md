### Hi, I'm Richard
***
I'm studying Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I'm interested in software, entrepreneurship, and VC money.

My most recent completed internship was at Jitto. I was one of 3 software engineers building their suite of web tools to deconstruct the death grip Loblaws and a few other companies have on the Canadian product market. 
- Did AWS (RDS, Lambda, Cloudformation)
- Did React
- Did Node.js

I also build side projects alot. Here is the most impressive:
- Wikigraph: measure distance from 1 wikipedia article to another. Lots of xml parsing, bitwise operations, gRPC, and Breadth First Search
